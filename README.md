# teensy_hid_gamepad

A USB HID Gamepad using CircuitPython. 
Originally developed for a Teensy 4.0 MCU but now targeted at [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/rp2040.html) development boards like [Pimoroni Tiny2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/tiny-2040?variant=39560012234835).

Should work on any MCU with a working CircuitPython port including USB HID support, with minor changes for board I/O.
